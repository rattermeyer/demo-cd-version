This repository demoes several projects that are versioned in one git
repository. This setup is not so common with git that often takes the
aproach to have smaller repos, but would still be an option to ease
continuous integration.

In this case, I would clone this repository to a specific location and
import the seperate projects independently in my IDE (IntelliJ or Eclipse)
